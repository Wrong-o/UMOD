Checking the spark plugs
The spark plugs are important engine
components, 
which 
should 
be
checked periodically, preferably by a
Yamaha dealer. Since heat and depos-
its will cause any spark plug to slowly
erode, they should be removed and
checked in accordance with the peri-
odic maintenance and lubrication
chart. In addition, the condition of the
spark plugs can reveal the condition of
the engine.
The porcelain insulator around the
center electrode of each spark plug
should be a medium-to-light tan (the
ideal color when the vehicle is ridden
normally), and all spark plugs installed
in the engine should have the same
color. If any spark plug shows a dis-
tinctly different color, the engine could
be operating improperly. Do not at-
tempt to diagnose such problems
yourself. Instead, have a Yamaha deal-
er check the vehicle.
If a spark plug shows signs of elec-
trode erosion and excessive carbon or
other deposits, it should be replaced.

Before installing a spark plug, the
spark plug gap should be measured
with a wire thickness gauge and, if
necessary, adjusted to specification.
Clean the surface of the spark plug
gasket and its mating surface, and
then wipe off any grime from the spark
plug threads.
NOTICE
ECA10841
Do not use any tools to remove or in-
stall the spark plug cap, otherwise
the ignition coil coupler may get
damaged. The spark plug cap may
be difficult to remove because the
rubber seal on the end of the cap fits
tightly. To remove the spark plug
cap, simply twist it back and forth
while pulling it out; to install it, twist
it back and forth while pushing it in.

In order to prevent clutch slip-
page (since the engine oil also
lubricates the clutch), do not
mix any chemical additives. Do
not use oils with a diesel speci-
fication of “CD” or oils of a high-
er quality than specified. In
addition, do not use oils labeled
“ENERGY CONSERVING II” or
higher.
Make sure that no foreign mate-
rial enters the crankcase.
6. Check the oil filler cap O-ring for
damage, and replace it if neces-
sary.
7. Install and tighten the oil filler cap.

Why Yamalube
YAMALUBE oil is a Genuine YAMAHA
Part born of the engineers’ passion
and belief that engine oil is an impor-
tant liquid engine component. We form
teams of specialists in the fields of me-
chanical engineering, chemistry, elec-
tronics and track testing, and have
them develop the engine together with
the oil it will use. Yamalube oils take full
advantage of the base oil’s qualities
and blend in the ideal balance of addi-
tives to make sure the final oil clears
our performance standards. Thus,
Yamalube mineral, semisynthetic and
synthetic oils have their own distinct
characters and value. Yamaha’s expe-
rience gained over many years of re-
search and development into oil since
the 1960’s helps make Yamalube the
best choice for your Yamaha engine.
EAUS1203
Coolant
The coolant level should be checked
regularly. In addition, the coolant must
be changed at the intervals specified in
the periodic maintenance chart.
TIP
If genuine Yamaha coolant is not avail-
able, use an ethylene glycol antifreeze
containing corrosion inhibitors for alu-
minum engines and mix with distilled
water at a 1:1 ratio.
EAU66512
To check the coolant level
Since the coolant level varies with en-
gine temperature, check when the en-
gine is cold.
1. Park the vehicle on a level surface.
2. With the vehicle in an upright posi-
tion, look at the coolant level in the
reservoir.
3. If the coolant is at or below the
minimum level mark, remove
cowling B to access the coolant
reservoir. (See page 7-9.)
4. Remove the coolant reservoir cap.
WARNING! Remove only the
coolant reservoir cap. Never at-
tempt to remove the radiator
cap when the engine is hot.
[EWA15162]

5. Add coolant to the maximum level
mark. NOTICE: If coolant is not
available, use distilled water or
soft tap water instead. Do not
use hard water or salt water
since it is harmful to the engine.
If water has been used instead
of coolant, replace it with cool-
ant as soon as possible, other-
wise the cooling system will not
be protected against frost and
corrosion. If water has been
added to the coolant, have a
Yamaha dealer check the anti-
freeze content of the coolant as
soon as possible, otherwise the
effectiveness of the coolant will
be reduced. [ECA10473]
6. Install the coolant reservoir cap.
7. Install the cowling.
EAU33032
Changing the coolant
The coolant must be changed at the in-
tervals specified in the periodic main-
tenance and lubrication chart. Have a
Yamaha dealer change the coolant.
WARNING! Never attempt to remove
the radiator cap when the engine is
hot. [EWA10382]

Checking the engine idling 
speed
Check the engine idling speed and, if
necessary, have it corrected by a
Yamaha dealer.
EAU21403
Valve clearance
The valves are an important engine
component, and since valve clearance
changes with use, they must be
checked and adjusted at the intervals
specified in the periodic maintenance
chart. Unadjusted valves can result in
improper 
air-fuel 
mixture, 
engine
noise, and eventually engine damage.
To prevent this from occurring, have
your Yamaha dealer check and adjust
the valve clearance at regular intervals.
TIP
This service must be performed when
the engine is cold.
EAU64412
Tires
Tires are the only contact between the
vehicle and the road. Safety in all con-
ditions of riding depends on a relatively
small area of road contact. Therefore, it
is essential to maintain the tires in good
condition at all times and replace them
at the appropriate time with the speci-
fied tires.
Tire air pressure
The tire air pressure should be
checked and, if necessary, adjusted
before each ride.
WARNING
EWA10504
Operation of this vehicle with im-
proper tire pressure may cause se-
vere injury or death from loss of
control.
The tire air pressure must be
checked and adjusted on cold
tires (i.e., when the temperature
of the tires equals the ambient
temperature).
The tire air pressure must be
adjusted in accordance with the
riding speed and with the total
Engine idling speed:

weight of rider, passenger, car-
go, and accessories approved
for this model.
WARNING
EWA10512
Never overload your vehicle. Opera-
tion of an overloaded vehicle could
cause an accident.
Tire inspection
The tires must be checked before each
ride. If the center tread depth reaches
the specified limit, if the tire has a nail
or glass fragments in it, or if the side-
wall is cracked, have a Yamaha dealer
replace the tire immediately.
TIP
The tire tread depth limits may differ
from country to country. Always com-
ply with the local regulations.
WARNING
EWA10472
Have a Yamaha dealer replace
excessively worn tires. Besides
being illegal, operating the vehi-
cle with excessively worn tires
decreases riding stability and
can lead to loss of control.
The replacement of all wheel
and brake-related parts, includ-
ing the tires, should be left to a
Yamaha dealer, who has the
necessary professional knowl-
edge and experience to do so.
Ride at moderate speeds after
changing a tire since the tire
surface must first be “broken
in” for it to develop its optimal
characteristics.

Tire information
This model is equipped with tubeless
tires and tire air valves.
Tires age, even if they have not been
used or have only been used occasion-
ally. Cracking of the tread and sidewall
rubber, sometimes accompanied by
carcass deformation, is an evidence of
ageing. Old and aged tires shall be
checked by tire specialists to ascertain
their suitability for further use.
WARNING
EWA10902
The front and rear tires should
be of the same make and de-
sign, otherwise the handling
characteristics of the motorcy-
cle may be different, which
could lead to an accident.
Always make sure that the valve
caps are securely installed to
prevent air pressure leakage.
Use only the tire valves and
valve cores listed below to
avoid tire deflation during a ride.
After extensive tests, only the tires list-
ed below have been approved for this
model by Yamaha.
WARNING
EWA10601
This motorcycle is fitted with super-
high-speed tires. Note the following
points in order to make the most ef-
ficient use of these tires.

Brand-new tires can have a rel-
atively poor grip on certain road
surfaces until they have been
“broken in”. Therefore, it is ad-
visable before doing any high-
speed riding to ride conserva-
tively for approximately 100 km
(60 mi) after installing a new tire.
The tires must be warmed up
before a high-speed run.
Always adjust the tire air pres-
sure according to the operating
conditions.

Cast magnesium wheels
To maximize the performance, durabil-
ity, and safe operation of your motor-
cycle, 
note 
the 
following 
points
regarding these wheels.
The 
wheel 
rims 
should 
be
checked for cracks, bends, warp-
age or damage before each ride. If
any damage is found, have a
Yamaha dealer replace the wheel.
Do not attempt even the smallest
repair to the wheel. A deformed or
cracked wheel must be replaced.
The wheel should be balanced
whenever the tire or wheel has
been changed or replaced. An un-
balanced wheel can result in poor
performance, adverse handling
characteristics, and shortened tire
life.
These wheels are made of magnesium
and require special care.
When balancing the wheel, use
press-on type weights to avoid
scratching the wheel.
Regularly inspect the wheel for
nicks and scratches. Use touch-
up paint or other sealant to pre-
vent corrosion.
Follow the instructions for clean-
ing provided on page 8-1.

Checking the brake lever free 
play
There should be no free play at the
brake lever end. If there is free play,
have a Yamaha dealer inspect the
brake system.
WARNING
EWA14212
A soft or spongy feeling in the brake
lever can indicate the presence of
air in the hydraulic system. If there is
air in the hydraulic system, have a
Yamaha dealer bleed the system be-
fore operating the vehicle. Air in the
hydraulic system will diminish the
braking performance, which may re-
sult in loss of control and an acci-
dent.
EAU36505
Brake light switches
The brake light should come on just
before braking takes effect. The brake
light is activated by switches connect-
ed to the brake lever and brake pedal.
Since the brake light switches are
components of the anti-lock brake sys-
tem, they should only be serviced by a

As the brake pads wear, it is normal for
the brake fluid level to gradually go
down.
A low brake fluid level may indi-
cate worn brake pads or brake
system leakage; therefore, be sure
to check the brake pads for wear
and the brake system for leakage.
If the brake fluid level goes down
suddenly, have a Yamaha dealer
check the cause before further rid-
ing.
WARNING
EWA15991
Improper maintenance can result in
loss of braking ability. Observe
these precautions:
Insufficient brake fluid may al-
low air to enter the brake sys-
tem, 
reducing 
braking
performance.
Clean the filler cap before re-
moving. Use only DOT 4 brake
fluid from a sealed container.
Use only the specified brake flu-
id; otherwise, the rubber seals
may deteriorate, causing leak-
age.
Refill with the same type of
brake fluid. Adding a brake fluid
other than DOT 4 may result in a
harmful chemical reaction.
Be careful that water does not
enter the brake fluid reservoir
when refilling. Water will signifi-
cantly lower the boiling point of
the fluid and may result in vapor
lock.
EAU22734
Changing the brake fluid
Have a Yamaha dealer change the
brake fluid every 2 years. In addition,
have the seals of the master cylinders
and brake calipers, as well as the brake
hoses replaced at the intervals listed

Troubleshooting
Although Yamaha motorcycles receive
a thorough inspection before shipment
from the factory, trouble may occur
during operation. Any problem in the
fuel, compression, or ignition systems,
for example, can cause poor starting
and loss of power.
The following troubleshooting charts
represent quick and easy procedures
for checking these vital systems your-
self. However, should your motorcycle
require any repair, take it to a Yamaha
dealer, whose skilled technicians have
the necessary tools, experience, and
know-how to service the motorcycle
properly.
Use only genuine Yamaha replace-
ment parts. Imitation parts may look
like Yamaha parts, but they are often
inferior, have a shorter service life and
can lead to expensive repair bills.
WARNING

When checking the fuel system, do
not smoke, and make sure there are
no open flames or sparks in the ar-
ea, including pilot lights from water
